/*  1. Create a function that adds up the integers in the following array var numbers
        = [10,20,30,40,50]. Do not use any array prototype methods, this must be
        completed using for loops and variables.
    2. Create a function that reverses the following array - var array1 =
        [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. Do not use array prototype method
        .reverse()
    3. Implement Fizz Buzz. Loop from 1 to 100. If the number is divisible by both 3 and
        5, print "fizzbuzz". Otherwise, if the number is divisible by 3, print "fizz", or, if the
        number is divisible by 5, print "buzz". If none of the above are true, print the
        number. This is a very common interview question! Try completing this on your
        own before looking up the answer.
    4. Challenge: Write a JavaScript program to construct the following pattern
        (see below), using a nested for loop
*/

function addNum() {
